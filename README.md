"TodoApp"
TodoApp is a simple task management application built with React. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and delete tasks. The application provides real-time notifications for task-related actions, such as adding a new task, deleting a task, and marking a task as complete or incomplete. Each task is assigned a unique ID, and the user interface displays the task ID along with the task text. The application offers a clean and intuitive interface for efficient task management.
